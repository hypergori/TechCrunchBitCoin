1
00:00:00,032 --> 00:00:04,334
Mining sits at the foundation of Bitcoin.

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:07,650
Initially people who were

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:11,162
running a bitcoin software and

4
00:00:11,187 --> 00:00:13,818
trying to win the bitcoin mining race

5
00:00:13,843 --> 00:00:19,752
were the sort of fanatics who had fallen in love with this idea

6
00:00:19,777 --> 00:00:25,285
Overtime Bitcoin mining has essentially become a specialized profession.

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:34,491
available to people who have some ability 
to setup these installation around the world.
And so

8
00:00:34,516 --> 00:00:39,246
Mining has increasingly become the specialized profession

9
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:42,015
that's  become something of problem because

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,729
the design of bitcoin software gives

11
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:49,522
decision making power to the miners

12
00:00:49,547 --> 00:00:53,956
And whatever software they choose to run

13
00:00:53,981 --> 00:01:00,172
that becomes the software and rules for  essentially the whole network.

14
00:01:00,197 --> 00:01:05,106
So these miners around the world has a sort of

15
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:11,256
voting power over  what the Bitcoin software and what the Bitcoin itself looks like

2. BITCOIN MINES AND MINERS
2100 MIL

18
00:01:25,513 --> 00:01:28,203
21 Millions:Final number of Bitcoins to be released by 2140

19
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:34,476
21 Millions:Final number of Bitcoins to be released by 2140
12.5 : Bitcoins released onto the network every 10 minutes in 2017

20
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:39,031
So when Satoshi Nakamoto came up with it 
The real key question is howto get these 21 million outthere.

21
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:41,897
if he all give it to himself , he would have huge burden.

22
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:50,880
**  he gives to the men of the world or to the women,
to the children, to the American, to the poor people in Africa
and starving people or to the Communists

23
00:01:50,905 --> 00:01:52,535
who do you choose  to give 21 million.

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,702
only fair he came up with was to give it for free
to whoever wants it.

25
00:01:57,727 --> 00:02:03,073
Miner's job is to take all of the valid transactions they see

26
00:02:03,098 --> 00:02:06,329
and gather up these transactions in what called blocks.

27
00:02:06,354 --> 00:02:10,295
and they perform this busy work. 
They are kind of in a race *install* the other miners

28
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,471
to have the privilege of being the cannonical record of transactions that happened.

29
00:02:14,496 --> 00:02:20,679
if they win their race. Then there is a very special transaction 
begining of every single block awards brand new Bitcoins.

30
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:25,444
As Bitcoin price rises,

31
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:31,171
it incentivises somebody to turn on mining equipment somehere in the word.

32
00:02:31,198 --> 00:02:35,443
then , that adds this
processing power to the netowork which
is seen by system.

33
00:02:35,468 --> 00:02:39,315
so the system makes an adjustment to make it harder to produce Bitcoin.

34
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:46,286
In my same power footprint here I produce essentially less and less Bitcoin overtime.

35
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:48,563
But the value of Bitcoin rises.

36
00:02:48,588 --> 00:02:55,363
We reach the point where
the determining factors and who can profitabily mine  bit contins

37
00:02:55,388 --> 00:03:01,168
is access to cheap computer hardware and access to cheap electricity

38
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:08,579
And Right now ,the place where  those 2 things are easiest to find is China.

39
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:17,891
And so , you have essentially 2/3 to 3/4 of all of Bitcoins being  mined in the world

40
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:21,103
 going to these mining  installations around China.

ZHU REI, CEO,UNIDENTIFIED BITCOIN MINE,SZEHUAN PROVINCE

There are fifteen people working in this facility.

43
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:53,431
Their job   is to look after all the hardware here.

44
00:03:53,456 --> 00:03:58,693
All of them live and work in the power plant.

45
00:04:11,972 --> 00:04:23,004
THose parts of the country with cheaper energy rates
are in remote areas, not in the cities.

46
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:29,092
So people don't really know where these miners are.

47
00:04:29,117 --> 00:04:33,366
Competition is really intense in China,

48
00:04:33,391 --> 00:04:39,197
and the number of people here 
getting into Bitcoin mining is rising rapidly.

49
00:04:39,222 --> 00:04:43,095
So, the bottom line is, when you are lucky enough
to be in a place like this,

50
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,056
where cost of electricity is so low,

51
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:52,266
well, you keep it to yourself.

52
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:58,032
They essentially by having majority mining power  they  hold all the cards for

53
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:01,945
whose transactions getting included that's  another big one. Think about that.

54
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:07,327
Think about the possibility that due to maybe a government or ruling or something.

55
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:13,473
No transactions originating in the  US  for Bitcoin should be accepted any of the blocks in China.

56
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:15,835
That's a very scary scary concept.

57
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:22,258
It should be extremely scary to the people who ve invested in businesses that are built on Bitcoin blockchain.

58
00:05:22,283 --> 00:05:25,620
On the side debates that you also see what you are talking about China,

59
00:05:25,645 --> 00:05:28,824
A question within the Bitcoin comminuty about the roles of miners play in China,

60
00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:35,630
adn whether or not there  should be some sort of concern 
for some attempts to counteract
 the growing power of China in mining space.

61
00:05:35,655 --> 00:05:37,609
in Bitcoin blockchain itself.

62
00:05:37,634 --> 00:05:41,421
It does raise very interesting issue around governance models of public  blockchain.

63
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:46,997
What do you do in the situation where one particular entity or a group of entity acting collectively,

64
00:05:47,022 --> 00:05:52,062
gain enough power in a open system that  they can begin  dictating the governance of  system.

65
00:05:52,087 --> 00:05:58,286
It's something of a test for the philosophy behind this technology.

66
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:01,986
I mean one of the basic ideas here  was that

67
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:09,637
people working together could create a better system
and could create a better software.

68
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:14,368
then any one start up or enteprenuer could

69
00:06:14,393 --> 00:06:17,702
I mean this was an idea of communal wisdom or hive mind

70
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:24,072
would be   more successful than anybody working in isolation.

71
00:06:24,097 --> 00:06:30,452
It is not at all  clear that  that  software being  developed by volunteers all around the world

72
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:37,578
is going to be able to  adapt quickly enough to keep up 
with this existing powers

73
00:06:37,603 --> 00:06:41,745
and all the resouces that  they have  put in the experiment.

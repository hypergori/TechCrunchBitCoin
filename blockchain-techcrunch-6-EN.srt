00:00:00,238 --> 00:00:10,094
The divide over how to use Bitcoin and Blockchain

2
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:13,911
is really a part of much broader debate

3
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:19,338
that our society are having right now  about open vs closed systems

4
00:00:19,363 --> 00:00:22,512
With virtual currencies in a blockchain

5
00:00:22,537 --> 00:00:25,383
the original believers in this technology

6
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:28,020
,I think, a lot of people in Silicon Valley

7
00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:34,652
still have this idea that most important part
 of the system is that it's open

8
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:38,233
that anybody can use it and anybody can participate

9
00:00:38,258 --> 00:00:46,469
just like in Wikipedia that anybody can comment and edit entries
 and add their expertise and knowledge to the system.

10
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:52,140
I think on Wall Street and in government

11
00:00:52,165 --> 00:01:02,284
There is a suspicion of sort-of open system that Bitcoin
and Ethereum represents where anybody can participate

12
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,995
In order to maintain the security of the system

13
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,376
on Wall Street and government

14
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:15,774
There is a desire to have a sort-of limited number of people, participating

15
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:21,137
so that you can essentially know 
that you can trust every body within the system

16

exactly i can use that ealier today

23
00:02:03,117 --> 00:02:08,307
we dont believe ****

24
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:12,583
R3 is currently building 
towards a  permission system , a private system

25
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,604
because that is the mandate we have got from our Banks

26
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:22,785
because they have been told they have strong understanding of 
client privacy laws and various different other  confidentiality provision

27
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,099
but also it's the mandate they are getting from the regulators 
so they have to play by a certain set of rules

28
00:02:27,124 --> 00:02:31,745
I don't particularly have much interest in private blockchain sector

29
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:39,884
It doesn't  seem to me that you get much benefit
 from having a closed ledger,a private ledger

30
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:43,266
sure there is some benefit.What is really different

31
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:51,893
between a private ledger built on blockchain technology and a private ledger built on sq database technology

32
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:56,471
Major financial institutions are skeptical about open ledgers for a set of reasons

33
00:02:56,496 --> 00:02:59,836
First of all , Wall street operates under a set of  regulatory constrains

34
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:02,356
that they cannot afford to just ignore

35
00:03:02,446 --> 00:03:07,232
Their central bankers or  their various different securities or derivative regulators. 
their conduct regulators

36
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:13,707
I have a front seat to the question about can bitcoin technology and blockchain technology work in regulated environment

37
00:03:13,732 --> 00:03:16,815
because I am on a board of the company called Coinbase which is

38
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:21,954
probably the leading exchange and hosted wallet provider here in United States

39
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:24,254
one of the leading company around the world

40
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:27,042
And they have to operate in a regulated environment

41
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:29,214
if you look at the Bitcoin debate  right now

42
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:31,858
where they are arguing over  the block size

43
00:03:31,883 --> 00:03:34,210
and they are having a trouble scaling that system

44
00:03:34,634 --> 00:03:38,563
and they are only at a  point of now where they can  handle 7 transactions a second

45
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:45,265
and The world global finance handles thousands if not tens of thousands
, hundreds of thousands of transactions every second

46
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,361
if you includes  credit card swipes and interest, trades and securities etc,etc.

47
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:54,266
I am not yet convinced the  private block chain is anything new

48
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:59,968
It's probably a tool to help  information sharing  between Banks

49
00:03:59,993 --> 00:04:10,896
But then , if you consider the information sharing has to be associated with common codes of business practice.

50
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:17,917
then you also have to consider that it is a  route towards cartelization of the   banking sector

51
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:21,791
and in worse case scenario , it creates one bank system

52
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:30,049
at a high level, I just kind-of  think it is  an industry  grappling 
with a new technology  not really liking what they see

53
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:33,581
Silicon Valley vision used to be *allow its evolving*

54
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,060
is one in which future of money

55
00:04:37,085 --> 00:04:39,838
looks nothing 5 or 10  years *from somewhere* the way it does now

56
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:45,444
the Eco-system is  different , participant is different.
banks and central banks don’t play the role they currently do now

57
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:48,614
They are developing technology to empower a new world

58
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,740
Wall street doesn't think like that.

59
00:04:50,765 --> 00:04:53,726
It could be quite disruptive to their business model

60
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:59,315
This is a network that you don’t get charged to move money on

61
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,534
and a big part of how banks and brokerages make money is they take a piece of a transaction

62
00:05:04,558 --> 00:05:09,268
Silicon valley institutions have kind of looked upon  banking is going well

63
00:05:09,294 --> 00:05:16,929
What do they really do ?
They deal with information , They deal with databases
They deal with risk

64
00:05:16,954 --> 00:05:19,189
Really we kind-of do that as well

65
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:23,179
So why shouldn’t we do
the business of banking
 we are technology firm

66
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:28,292
Most of Silicon Valley of history ,  Wall Street has  been the customer.

67
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:31,718
But I think in the past decade ,

68
00:05:31,743 --> 00:05:37,020
going back to maybe the late  90's  or early part of 2000's

69
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:44,060
a lot of entrepreneurs and really entrepreneurs are
aware these things starts and VCs tend to follow

70
00:05:44,085 --> 00:05:49,784
started to see Wall Street as an industry that they could compete with

71
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:54,348
Banks are   always being technology firms they have never not been technology firms

72
00:05:54,373 --> 00:05:58,045
the only difference really is that banks are technology firms

73
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,536
who take risk and the after  a while

74
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:05,758
are getting trouble for taking that risk and suffered with consequences.

75
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:08,797
a lot people use the example Uber and AirBnB

76
00:06:08,822 --> 00:06:13,709
And the example there is  , they wanted to be innovative

77
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:18,829
they went out and  broke a few rules 
busted up some china and china shop and ask for forgiveness later

78
00:06:18,854 --> 00:06:23,810
Well that's one  thing if you are taking on Taxi Cab commission of a town somewhere

79
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:28,845
that's  another thing if you are taking on the  Hotel Authority of  municipality somewhere

80
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,125
If you are taking on Central bank or Federal Reserve

81
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,061
If you are taking on the equivalent of Security and Exchange commission

82
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:38,347
And you just gonna decide  not play by the rules

83
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:43,940
you just gonna decide to break the law 
where they  have both criminal and civil  ability co** to hold your account

84
00:06:43,965 --> 00:06:46,253
That's a much much bigger issue.

85
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,295
The idea just deciding to break the rules *up until* entire financial services
is frankly naive.

86
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,341
I think that there  changes are afoot in society.

87
00:06:54,366 --> 00:07:01,461
that are actually a  begging for these technologies 
to get to  the point  where we can  actually build stuff  with them

88
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:12,608
Bitcoin and blockchain technologies are
waiting for a killer app or a series of killer apps

89
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:20,070
that will make it obvious to people why this technology really matters

90
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:26,565
there's one vision future which either be open system like bitcoin and ethererum

91
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:31,198
or the closed systems being developed banks and  governments

92
00:07:31,223 --> 00:07:37,365
I think there is another vision of future
 in which systems can  exist along side each other

93
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:44,146
and interact with each other depending on
what somebody wants to do with their money

94
00:07:48,303 --> 00:07:53,766
Change from one economy to another

95
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,197
is likely to be   incrediblly painful when we get the other side
It will better.

00:00:03,327 --> 00:00:09,043
Bitcoin first emerged in 2008.
The initial paper and software

3
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:13,370
came from someone going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto.

4
00:00:13,428 --> 00:00:16,635
The idea behind the system was

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:22,366
that it would be a final network outside of the control of government.

6
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:25,539
outside of control of Banks.

7
00:00:25,564 --> 00:00:30,575
And it would do this by creating a sort of network.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:37,111
much like the internet that was run by people actually using the currency.

9
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:43,822
in 2011, a series of booms and busts overtook

10
00:00:43,847 --> 00:00:47,630
the bitcoin and brought it into public consciousness.

11
00:00:47,655 --> 00:00:55,080
Like any utopian technology, bitcoin has  really run up against

12
00:00:55,105 --> 00:00:59,219
the outer limits of what it's trying to do.

13
00:00:59,244 --> 00:01:01,665
as it has  spread around the world.

17
00:01:18,965 --> 00:01:24,317

19
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:51,755
People tend not to understand much about Bitcoin.

20
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,851
what the hell it is ,how it functions.

21
00:01:54,876 --> 00:01:57,330
And they dont get
that it's just a file.

22
00:01:57,356 --> 00:02:00,938
a book where all the transactions that 
are taking place around the world are written.

23
00:02:00,963 --> 00:02:03,700
And the contents of that book
is public and free to access.

24
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:07,005
And the good thing, the wonderful thing,
the revolutionary thing,

25
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,991
the groundbreaking thing of all this is

26
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:11,085
that the book is being writte by everyone -
in consensus.

27
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,413
Imagine there are a few people
who love a book, like, i dont know, lets say

28
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:18,109
Lets reach some sort of consenss about
the Christians, the Bible, that kind of thing,

29
00:02:18,134 --> 00:02:19,925
or ,say a consensus about the Jews,
the Torah

30
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:23,364
We are taking about a book in which

31
00:02:23,391 --> 00:02:25,574
all the finacial users reach a consensus

32
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,213
and in a way that we can all agree on what was written there,

33
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:30,460
and everyone can constantly check it.

34
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:32,429
That is exactly what Btcoin is

35
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:35,725
The first time in the history of humanity that we all agree,

36
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:37,381
in a technological way,

37
00:02:37,405 --> 00:02:40,325
to make something together, something we all agree on.

38
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:43,438
That is a paradigm shift, which gives humanity
this idea of widespread coming together.

39
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,605
We are going to insist that it works

40
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:47,092
in a decentralized way.

41
00:02:47,118 --> 00:02:48,518
The future is brilliant.

42
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:53,290
Never before was someone able 
to put it together in a real real system,
a software system.

because a double spending was a  biggest thing
you could not  overcome.

44
00:02:56,661 --> 00:03:00,040
With a gold , it is easier.something phisical is easy.
I give you a piece of gold.

45
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:02,341
you have it. I dont have it .
because i gave it to you.

46
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:05,093
With digital information, 
i give you a digital photograph.

47
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:07,341
In a essense, I give you a copy of it.

48
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:10,301
when i give it to you, you have it.
and I also have it.

49
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:13,212
With currecy and  digital money, we cannot allow for that.

50
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:16,325
If we did allow for that,then it's  practically useless, right?

51
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,950
So, how do you solve that problem?

52
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:21,021
Researchers were looking  for that last 20-40 years.

53
00:03:21,046 --> 00:03:23,110
And finally ,in 2008 and 2009,

54
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:25,798
We have a version of Bitcon that solve the problem.

55
00:03:25,823 --> 00:03:28,296
through the notion of global ledger  called blockchain.

56
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:30,220
Blockchain is a buss word.

so , I am not entirely sure what it means.
I think It's entirely depends on the speaker.

58
00:03:34,342 --> 00:03:39,238
In general , I think,when they say Blockchain.
They mean the idea of

59
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:44,909
a record of transactions,
that's secure and distributed.

60
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:50,068
FRED WILSON,CO-FOUNDER,UNION SQUARE VENTURES,NEW YORK
Where we sit Today, companies like Facebook, Google , Amazon, Apple,

61
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:52,834
They are increasingly sitting on all of our data.

62
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,613
Everytime somebody *en-masses* big monopolies

63
00:03:55,638 --> 00:03:59,763
Something comes along that's 
just completely and totaly a game changer.

64
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:02,156
And I think it's blockchain technology.

65
00:04:02,181 --> 00:04:05,845
VITALIK BUTERIN,FOUNDER,ETHEREUM,TORONTO,MOSCOW,SHANGHAI
It is a buss word and but at the same time,
the word refers to a paticular thing.

66
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:08,992
the particular thing is really useful and 
you can a lot of stuff on it.

67
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:10,751
There are lot of ways to describe it.

68
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:16,717
like one phrase that
Robert Sams has used ,that I really like, is 
Decentralized automation.

69
00:04:16,743 --> 00:04:22,557
So, the idea you can ,sort of , run
various kinds of processes in a way that
number one is completely automated.

70
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:25,302
So you  get just  huge gains in efficiency out of that.

71
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:28,402
And the number two is  that decentralized
which means that

72
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:32,532
No1. Like there is no sort of process that can get corrupted 
 by one particular entity.

73
00:04:32,557 --> 00:04:36,369
And No2. there is no process that just requires a central entity and then

74
00:04:36,404 --> 00:04:41,094
sort of natural *yield* creates too much
oppotunity for that central entity
to become a monopoly.

75
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:44,533
*** ways in which this technology in its current iteration.

76
00:04:44,558 --> 00:04:48,029
and by that I  mean, distributed ledger rather than bitcoin.

77
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,685
moves are away from the founding principle of Bitcoin

78
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:56,332
around anonymity and replaces it with certain known actors.

79
00:04:56,357 --> 00:04:58,180
With regulated finacial systems.

80
00:04:58,205 --> 00:05:01,581
But , none of that , inevitablly means anything.

81
00:05:01,607 --> 00:05:08,131
Here is a way I would say ,
People always overestimate what technology can do in 2 years,
but  underestimate what it can do in 10.

82
00:05:12,056 --> 00:05:16,476
LARRY SUMMERS, FORMER SECURETARY OF TREASURY USA
People who think somehow the Bitcoin is gonna

83
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:21,517
bring in some Libertarian paradise where we are not going 
to have KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER rules

84
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:24,733
and not going to have rules on Money transfer. That will not happen.

85
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:29,964
People who think that  all the currencies are 
going to be depotched and gonna have a hyper inflation.

86
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:33,660
Bitcoin is salvation . I thnk they are wrong too.

87
00:05:33,677 --> 00:05:39,677
in a world where we've got a real struggle 
to get up to 2 percent inflation.

88
00:05:39,702 --> 00:05:42,821
Anywhere industrial world. But,

89
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:47,973
is the Blockchain technology gonna be  fundamental to reducing  fractions ?

90
00:05:47,998 --> 00:05:51,757
I think  the answer is overwelmingly likely  that it is going to be  Yes.

91
00:05:51,782 --> 00:05:54,990
ROGER VER,EARLY BITCOIN EVANGELIST, TOKYO
Larry Summers was talking about how blockchain is here to stay

92
00:05:55,022 --> 00:06:00,261
And  Bitcoin technology is amazing and this gonna change
 the ways that   financial system world to work.

93
00:06:00,337 --> 00:06:03,813
but *fairly*  bitcoiners like myself think we gonna be able to have

94
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:08,989
anonymous transactions that  are private from the  government
and the people are actually allowed to do what they want  with their money

95
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:12,965
And he said we were wrong about that.
I think one of us is wrong .

96
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,605
I dont  think it's  going to be  me.

97
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,841
I kind of knew with  that day would come in which the people 
that share my world view are going to   be  the  minority.

98
00:06:19,868 --> 00:06:24,366
In Bitcoin, but  I think that's also a sign that  we are winning

99
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:27,546
Now ,this  many other people are interested in this technology.

100
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:32,556
someone seems to have shared silimar  world view to my own created. That's pretty exciting.

101
00:06:32,604 --> 00:06:37,636
bank of america, Wells Fargo and western union  are here in space.

102
00:06:37,661 --> 00:06:39,637
That means we are winning.

103
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:43,125
Hopefully it means they wont able to *co-opt* what we've built so far

104
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:49,341
and turn it into sort of  hierachical system in which, you know , governments are 
able to monitor every single transaction that people make

105
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:51,985
That would be my nightmare outcome.

106
00:06:52,010 --> 00:07:01,504
There is now a sort of this battle between , you know, 
the people who originally brought this thing into the world

107
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:10,864
and who wanted this  to be a sort of revolutinarily new technology that would   help   free people from governments and banks.

108
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,865
And now  on the other side , there are Governemts and Banks.

109
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:24,024
they themselves are trying  use this technology to 
change the way that we use money and 
change the way the infomation is stored.

110
00:07:24,049 --> 00:07:28,912
I think it is very much an open question as to  where this ends up.

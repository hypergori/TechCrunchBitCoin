1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,014
I think Bitcoin has been a sort-of  holding pattern
for last year or so.

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:15,723
As people try to figure out whether the problem
Bitcoin has encountered can be resolved

3
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:21,432
Or whether you are going to need to  move to some other system

4
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:24,036
to get the benefits that Bitcoin promised

5
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:29,118

Consensus Conference
May 2,2016
New York

10
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:58,646
a few hours after computer scientist
Craig wright declares he's Satoshi Nakamoto

11
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:02,223
You were saying it doesn’t matter that
Satoshi is Craig Wright ?

12
00:01:02,248 --> 00:01:06,230
Yeah, I don’t think he has that  much power,

13
00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:11,369
Back before the announcement,

14
00:01:11,394 --> 00:01:12,810
I thought it was one person because you know

15
00:01:12,835 --> 00:01:17,106
honestly  people think it is secretly  massive achievement

16
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:21,822
But it just was hitting at the right thing and at a right time.

17
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:26,617
I thought it was just someone,you know,
 random 30 to50 year old male ,quite possibly Japanese.

18
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:31,106
** supposed to be Japanese **

VITALIK BUTERIN , FOUNDER, ETHEREUM,TORONTO,MOSCOW,SHANGHAI
So I discover the Bitcoin back in  2011

20
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:37,005
Actually , First time I heard about it  my Dad told me.
And he said,

21
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,797
It's very interesting new currency.
It is not issued by any kind of government and de-centralized.

22
00:01:40,822 --> 00:01:42,369
I should check it out.

23
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:48,879
I started to work seriously getting on the floor
I was trying to earn bitcoins myself by just writing articles
on various different blogs.

24
00:01:48,904 --> 00:01:55,638
Eventually I started to get  more and more into it
and I ended up  co-founding a Bitcoin magazine.

25
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:58,247
So in High-tech,  we talk about networking effect

26
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,713
like e-bay had fantastic network effect

27
00:02:00,737 --> 00:02:04,726
there are  two sides, buyers and sellers , people auctioning stuff.

28
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:06,996
and people wanna buy a stuff.

29
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:13,444
The bigger the market places,The more buyers you attract,
the more buyers there are  The more people sell there.

30
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:14,451
That's network effect.

31
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:17,017
eBay is the 800 pound gorilla.

32
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:21,587
In the crypt currency space,right now Bitcoins is the 800 pound gorilla.

33
00:02:21,612 --> 00:02:26,323
In terms of technological proof of concept, it is  inspired developers around the world

34
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:33,808
financial institutions, governments, stock exchanges,
pretty much everybody doing anything in financial services.

35
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:37,623
has paid attention to the technological achievement

36
00:02:37,648 --> 00:02:42,034
the currency and *the store* value *less*

37
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:52,325
Blockchain technology that Bitcoin introduced
has been eclipsing the original application of blockchain ,Bitcoin.

38
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,928
At the end of 2013, people are getting  interested in blockchain technology

39
00:02:55,953 --> 00:03:01,986
they are getting interested in this idea particularly
you can  use it for the application other than Bitcoin.

40
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:04,979
Bitcoin currency and Blockchain technology are 2 different things.

Mission Statement: Make it easier
 for consumers and businesses to use blockchain technologies

43
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:30,591
World can change completely based on what this technology can do

44
00:03:30,616 --> 00:03:35,230
It is like an alien technology basicaly like  we've never have it  before

45
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:37,921
Now we've  gotten everyone rushing to play with it.

46
00:03:37,946 --> 00:03:40,887
I think that's what's exciting about it

47
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:46,295
if you look at for different developers like build products

48
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,176
They always wanna like to try out new cool stuff.

49
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:55,715
if they are building before before the internet,building software.
 started building web pages which is really  cool.

50
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,822
and then started to build web applications

51
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,857
mobile got much more cool

52
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:05,964
more challenging or  more new
 mobile instead of web

53
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:09,133
I think that blockchain is kind-of that next step.

54
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:12,123
Consensus 2016, may 2-4, 2016
Making Blockchain Real
New York City

55
00:04:12,147 --> 00:04:15,187
So 1.1 billion dollars has been raised today

56
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:18,180
by  cryptcurrency and blockchain start-ups

57
00:04:18,205 --> 00:04:20,456
That's really really significant number

58
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:26,432
The other point that is
interesting with Q1 especially
that we saw a reversal of the trend

59
00:04:26,457 --> 00:04:34,858
has been declining
level of investment in the industry of last several quarters
both in terms of overall fund flow and average deal size

60
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:39,933
This really changed in Q1 with emergence of blockchain
is the distinct investment category.

61
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:44,264
Identity Mind Global is a provider of risk management services.

62
00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:48,528
We see a blockchain really as a new medium for financial asset

63
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:56,903
t0 is a platform for exchanging digital assets
which we've created using a blockchain technology
It specialized to exchange. ...

64
00:04:56,952 --> 00:05:02,999
Having to have a piece of plastic and you gotta remember with you.
what you can do is you could use your mobile device

65
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:13,036
We especially started with Bitcoin blockchain,public blockchain. We are gonna move now
next to Etherium public blockchain. eventually connects to multiple blockchains.

66
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:14,882
We are build a proof of concept

67
00:05:14,907 --> 00:05:17,345
decentralize the energy company

68
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,165
that connects neighbors in the rural environment

69
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:24,764
and counts the consumption and production of electricity

70
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:26,585
on the block chain

71
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,273
Satoshi and Craig Wright, the news about who Satoshi is

72
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:34,643
Do you believe Craig Wright and does it matter ?

73
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,506
I am  Satoshi,   I am kidding.

74
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:44,319
Does it matter to me or to us ?  I don’t know , I guess not.

75
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,709
We refer to ourselves as   Bitcoin agnostic.

76
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:53,809
If Bitcoin finds itself successful , Great.
If Bitcoin doesn’t find itself successful ,that's  Great.
I doesn’t impact what we are trying to do.

77
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:58,318
I think here we are pretty agnostic , in terms of which one is the one.

78
00:05:58,343 --> 00:06:03,201
when companies are fighting for your eyeballs using blockchain tech

79
00:06:03,226 --> 00:06:05,703
competing blockchain tech. That's really what it *starts*.

80
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:09,215
Right now everyone is still building  cars to start a race

81
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:18,896
Everyone still ,you know , this is in development .you know, Barclays got this program.
They got this programing like Common Wealth Bank.

82
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:29,461
All these big institutions are starting to build places and dedicated  block chain labs
have these all these people  getting the resources and money get throwing at tit.

83
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:33,430
I am not saying that those guys are gonna be the reason why we all feel it  but

84
00:06:33,455 --> 00:06:37,562
might be a bunch of  hackers sitting in the bed room  that  make something really awesome.

85
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:41,854
that  change your life And that could be it.

86
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,447
I don't know We will wait and see.

87
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:46,946
Beyond that, there is the Etherium vision

88
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:51,464
This isn't just going to be  a place for financial transactions.

89
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:59,830
THis is going to be how basicaly  organizations
and  informational flow around the world happens as well

90
00:06:59,855 --> 00:07:02,349
In some way It's more ambitious.

91
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:10,893
That's a vision of the future in which
you essentially have enormous global computer

92
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:18,276
on which all of software and decision making and political processes can run.

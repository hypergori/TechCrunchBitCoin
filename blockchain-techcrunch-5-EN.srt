00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:09,147
Ethereum was built to be
a sort of new and improved version of Bitcoin

2
00:00:09,172 --> 00:00:13,181
and to do things Bitcoin couldn't do

3
00:00:13,206 --> 00:00:20,794
Original aim of Ethereum was to create
not just a decentralized money

4
00:00:20,819 --> 00:00:25,575
but essentially a decentralized global computer

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,732
that could do computational problems

6
00:00:29,758 --> 00:00:34,474
Ethereum has its own currency Ether

7
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:39,719
The Ether are really there to service as a sort-of gas

8
00:00:39,744 --> 00:00:47,382
for the computations that are going on
on this  network  of computers that run Ethereum

July 30,2015: Release date of the first live version of Ethereum
 $160 Million : Peak value of Ether raised by the Decentralized Autonomous Organization(DAO)
 $50 Million : Value of Ether stolen in a hack on the DAO

12
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:23,910
The original reason I like the name is that Ether was

VITALIK BUTERIN, FOUNDER ETHEREUM,TORONTO MOSCOW SHANGHAI
This is a sort of thing  the scientist hypothesizing about it  in 19 century
people were thinking

14
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:34,375
****travels through water
so what the light waves travel through

15
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:38,816
They hypothesize the existence of medium  kind-of
permeates the entire universe

16
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:42,135
That in itself is  a kind of invisible

17
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,760
but It provides us kind-of a global reference frame.

18
00:01:44,785 --> 00:01:47,726
It is in some sense ,you-know,sort-of the base the universe runs on.

19
00:01:47,777 --> 00:01:51,333
And actually I felt that was kind-of fitting analogy for what I wanted to do

20
00:01:54,674 --> 00:01:57,856
Bitcoin has the wrong approach.

21
00:01:57,881 --> 00:02:03,311
I would say Ethereum boasts features and opportunity
to do the thing Bitcoin doesn't .

22
00:02:03,336 --> 00:02:08,361
It's like saying that a telephone can beat an orange.

00:02:17,796 --> 00:02:21,010
JOSEPH LUBIN, FOUNDER CONSENSYS,ETHEREUM CONSULTING FIRM,NEW YORK

Ethererum is a decentralized application platform.

24
00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:27,958
Its parent ,Bitcoin,
is more of a platform

25
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:30,642
for transmission and storage of value

26
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:37,466
So Bitcoin was essentially an experiment
in monetary theory gone wildly successful

27
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,386
You can think of ethereum as the decentralized world wide web.

28
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:45,614
It will eventually be able to run all the different
kinds of applications

29
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:48,073
that we see on the World wide web

30
00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:54,670
The end of the day , it's kind-of fabric for
**** you could almost
describe it as a new Internet Infrastructure

31
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:57,289
Eventually it runs Facebook-like application

32
00:02:57,314 --> 00:03:00,372
All the differences that would be Peer-to-Peer

33
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:04,170
decentralized  rather than server-client type architecture

34
00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:09,868
ownership of data , ownership of communication or informational emissions

35
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:15,026
will rest with  the users of the system rather than
owners like  the company like Facebook

36
00:03:15,053 --> 00:03:18,982
I think Vitalik knows what he is building

37
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:24,596
a giant globally distributed re-programmable supercomputer

38
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,505
on the  scale of the mankind never seen before

39
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,335
And he is doing  it through a mechanism

40
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:35,521
which initially supports this concept of  Smart Contracts

41
00:03:35,546 --> 00:03:37,386
and issues a token  just like Bitcoin

42
00:03:37,412 --> 00:03:40,371
So there is a value being created by the  mining that we are doing.

43
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:44,847
THe biggest differences that ethererum produces mines

44
00:03:44,872 --> 00:03:50,647
that are reprogrammable to tasks
that we don’t necessary know what they are gonna do yet

45
00:03:50,672 --> 00:03:54,443
One of the highest ambitions of  Ethereum from the beginning

46
00:03:54,468 --> 00:04:00,329
was that you would actually be able to
program

47
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:04,727
the functioning of entire corporations

48
00:04:04,752 --> 00:04:07,649
into this global computer

49
00:04:07,674 --> 00:04:14,413
And You would have not just
a decentralized currency
but decentralized company

50
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:19,446
that would run according to the rules
 that you have programed into this network

51
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:28,660
so there was always this idea
that Ethereum might allow
what people called Decentralized Autonomous Organization

52
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,005
So Decentralized Autonomous Organization ,

53
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,688
This idea that you can have kind-of *automatons*
that are written in code  that set on the blockchain

54
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:38,104
in that , you govern through smart contracts,

55
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:43,841
could be like some voting mechanism,
could be voting by projection markets
or some other new thing

56
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:49,274
would be sort-of a company that would be run
not according to human decision making

57
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:55,692
and human rules ,but  Instead  according to rules that you programed into Ethereum network.

58
00:04:55,717 --> 00:05:00,954
It can actually  leave the decision making up to an Artificial Intelligence

59
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:04,734
So if you would have a board ,you can basically say ,hey we  can't come to the consensus

60
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,539
so, let's just refer this to AI

61
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:12,097
and everyone just delegates the roles to robots and robots make decision for them

62
00:05:12,122 --> 00:05:16,432
then eventually you can imagine that many boards are just run by AI.

63
00:05:16,457 --> 00:05:18,413
and occasionally intervene by humans

64
00:05:18,437 --> 00:05:23,916
DAO attracted something like 150 million dollars

65
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:26,429
in the course of a little over a month

66
00:05:26,454 --> 00:05:31,434
basically on the first days that it was operational

67
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:38,222
you had this attacker who came in and manged
to take advantage of the contracts in a way

68
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:45,561
that basically siphoned about the half of the money into an account under the control of the attacker

69
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:48,910
one saving grace in this attack

70
00:05:48,938 --> 00:05:51,668
was that money that was siphoned off

71
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:58,547
because of the way the DAO was written
couldn't  be used for 30days

72
00:05:58,576 --> 00:06:02,481
so begun this countdown

73
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:09,709
to try to figure out how to stop the attacker from getting control of 60 million dollars

74
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:15,473
so we have this time in order to see to determine
 whether we gonna do something about it or where we just going to let it.

75
00:06:15,497 --> 00:06:22,733
I don’t think that Ethereum  has the balls to leave the fact as is.

76
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:29,664
are you hard-forking the entire blockchain?

77
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:35,243
It set off this really pretty philosophical debate about

78
00:06:35,268 --> 00:06:38,522
how to deal with the problem like this

79
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:43,667
in the realm of smart contracts and virtual currency

80
00:06:43,692 --> 00:06:49,931
you see, one of the great attractions of the blockchain technology
and Bitcoin and Ethereum was

81
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:54,958
was that this record of transactions going back in time could never been changed

82
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:57,512
that is one of the reason that this is  so valuable

83
00:06:57,537 --> 00:07:04,922
you could look back and know that a transaction happened
know that nobody could temper with that ,nobody could change it

84
00:07:04,947 --> 00:07:10,091
once you had a DAO , people wanted to go back and change this contract

85
00:07:10,116 --> 00:07:13,644
so that the person who seized all this money

86
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,536
that those transactions wouldn't be valid

87
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:22,167
but it struck at the very core of what the Ethereum was supposed to be.

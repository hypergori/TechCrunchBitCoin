Bitcoin is supposed to run on a sort of Democratic process.

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,405
aimed  at  reaching a consensus.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:16,669
But over the last year or so , It's
been increasingly hard to find any consensus
about what this thing should look like.

4
00:00:16,694 --> 00:00:27,387
At the most basic level a battle over a Bitcoin today is about
how many transactions should be running through the network.

5
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:36,294
On one side , you have this camp that wants to expand the
number of transactions that can go through the network

6
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:43,246
So that anyone can send the transaction over the network
anytime essentially for free

7
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:49,861
On the other side, you have this camp that essentially wants to keep
Bitcoin smaller

8
00:00:49,888 --> 00:00:56,110
in order to assure its security and de-centralization of  the network.

9
00:00:56,135 --> 00:01:01,724
This battle has  become a sort of  political civil war
within the Bitcoin community

10
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:08,772
where the two sides are really fighting over
the fate what this system looks like.

III. Bitcoin in Search of Itself

13
00:01:22,756 --> 00:01:25,341
1 Megabyte: Cap on the amount of data processed by the Bitcoin network every 10 minutes

14
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:35,267
1 Megabyte : Cap on the amount of data processed by the Bitcoin network every 10 minutes
 7 : Maximum number of transactions the Bitcoin network can handle every second

15
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:45,724
We are moving to a potentially dangerous point of information

16
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:51,294
Today's society has less a kind of  freedoms of expression and freedoms of  association

17
00:01:51,319 --> 00:02:01,842
than previous generations because the technology didn't exist and wasn't sort of archiving and collecting
at all and the conversations are happening in physical environment where everything is recorded.

18
00:02:02,384 --> 00:02:07,265
As things move onto the Internet, *as default* everything is being recorded

19
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,381
and you also see this with sort of reactions to Snowden's revelations that

20
00:02:12,406 --> 00:02:15,580
things are actually more invasive than people anticipated

21
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:21,143
and National government are sort of  probing everything up about all basically everybody

You don’t have to have committed a crime or be suspicious to commit a crime

23
00:02:25,027 --> 00:02:28,992
They just are recording all just in case they want to  look *further*

24
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:38,915
What encryption technology  does is  hold the balance back of it so that
 people are regaining  that privacy expectations they have

25
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:45,130
As we work on  improving Bitcoin and scaling Bitcoin
you have to preserve the  security properties.

26
00:02:45,155 --> 00:02:50,780
Bitcoin security and permissionlessness depends on de-centralization.

So, Today we have this 1 Megabyte blocks which effectively goes about 5 to 7 transactions per second.

28
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:02,378
And for the first 7 years, its never been a problem.
Now we are in the 8th year,

29
00:03:02,403 --> 00:03:06,727
blocks are getting *full*  its kind of the highway, 8 lanes highways are finally getting congested.

30
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:12,947
So, now the questions is  ,do we impose or   just build 69 lane highway or  32 lane highway
that's kind of ridiculous.

31
00:03:12,972 --> 00:03:16,545
The simplest engineering solution is to make the block size bigger.

32
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,837
We impose in higher throughput  more cars, more buses , more carpooling. That kind of stuff.

33
00:03:21,862 --> 00:03:27,729
It kind of combination of both
The way I see it is
Not just transporting a  Bitcoin layer.

34
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:31,482
But the additional layer on top of Bitcion layers, we call it  Layer 2 services.

35
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:35,350
where there are sidechains, other technology like a  lightening

36
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:39,310
Those will solve some of the  capacity and transaction problems

37
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:43,091
Layer 2 protocols are more network efficient.

38
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:49,437
They don’t broadcast transactions.
They send transactions between the people involved in payment
 and maybe routers.

39
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:54,563
And they also improve the speed of transaction
So transaction can clear *quite* instantly.

40
00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:58,820
whereas Bitcoin transactions have some kind of tradeoff

41
00:03:58,844 --> 00:04:03,293
where you might get 10 min or  20min settlement time
depending on the amount **

42
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:07,558
a part of the engineering community thinks that better solution is that

43
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,441
go with what called Off-blockchain solutions

44
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:17,441
where transactions don’t settle on the Bitcoin blockchain
but happen off of  the Bitcoin blockchain

45
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:22,084
This's  been a lot of work on that, a lot of  innovation on that
I am actually pretty excited about all of that  work

46
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:24,123
It's really interesting technical work.

47
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:29,412
My big disagreement has been that we should not put all of our eggs in one basket

48
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:34,340
we should also do the dumb engineering thing
 in just increasing the block size now

49
00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:37,940
 because there is no reason not to.

50
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:42,766
The scaling advantages from layer 2 are much larger and increasing the block size.

51
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:49,308
Specificity I want to say that assuming the layer
2 technology * pans out* most people expect.

52
00:04:49,396 --> 00:04:54,808
It is probable that story next year  would be the different one
which is the enormous *size of*  capacity.

53
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:59,237
You are saying that the debate we are having now
about scaling vs decentralizing

54
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:01,687
might not be a debate  a year from now.

55
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:03,803
yeah , I think that  is *my* expectation.

56
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:14,670
All the transactions in a block can carry a  transaction fee that's paid to the miners
as a* bribe* essentially to include my transaction in your block instead of  somebody else's

57
00:05:14,695 --> 00:05:18,092
If I  have my way , we  will lhave much bigger blocks.

58
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,369
Transaction fee is always really low.

59
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:24,584
if you do a math of millions of transactions in a block

60
00:05:24,609 --> 00:05:28,913
each paying  is a cent or half of cent for a transaction fee

61
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:32,126
that will more that make up for declining the block award

62
00:05:32,151 --> 00:05:38,759
The opponents who want scaling fast are saying  we should make the block bigger
and put in lot of transactions.

63
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:42,531
Downside is if you make the blocks really big,

64
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:47,944
then it affects how well other people can own and distribute this global ledger

65
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:54,926
so only  a few people can keep up with so-called big blocks
the world falls in more centralized way of managing Bitcoin.

66
00:05:54,951 --> 00:06:05,678
Ideological concern is that we will end up in a place where
Bitcoin is only a tool for elites and  Big companies
I think that those are really overblown.

67
00:06:05,703 --> 00:06:11,889
Initially I think there was an idea that Bitcoin could be a lot of different things

68
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,911
that could be a digital gold

69
00:06:14,936 --> 00:06:18,345
also could be a new kind of Paypal

70
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,052
where you can run transactions around the world

71
00:06:21,077 --> 00:06:29,578
As time is  going on , I think that it become  clear
that if the system is going to expand
It cannot be everything to everyone

72
00:06:29,603 --> 00:06:31,982
It has to choose what it wants to be

00:00:00,238 --> 00:00:10,094
The divide over how to use Bitcoin and Blockchain

2
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:13,911
is really a part of much broader debate

3
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:19,338
that our society are having right now  about open vs closed systems

4
00:00:19,363 --> 00:00:22,512
with virtual currency in a blockchain

5
00:00:22,537 --> 00:00:25,383
original believers in this technology

6
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:28,020
I think a lot of people in Sillicon Valley

7
00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:34,652
still have this idea that most important part of the system is that it's open

8
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:38,233
that anybody can use it and anybody can participate

9
00:00:38,258 --> 00:00:46,469
just like wikipedia that anybody can comment and edit entries
 and add their expertise and knowledge to the system.

10
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:52,140
I think Wall Street and government

11
00:00:52,165 --> 00:01:02,284
There is a suspition of sort-of open systen that Bitcoin
and Ethereum represents where anybody can participate

12
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,995
In order to maintain the security of the system

13
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,376
on Wall Street and government

14
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:15,774
There is a desire to have a sort-of limited number of people, participating

15
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:21,137
you can essentially know that you can trust every body in the system

00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:54,372

00:01:54,397 --> 00:01:59,320

00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:02,692


24
00:02:03,117 --> 00:02:08,307


25
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:12,583
R3 is currently building a system , private system

26
00:02:27,124 --> 00:02:31,745



27
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:39,884
It does seem to me that you get much benefit from closed ledger, private ledger

28
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:43,266
sure there is some benefit.What is really different

29
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:51,893
between a private ledger built on blockchain technology and a private ledge built on sql database technology

30
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:56,471
major financial institutions are skeptical about open ledgers for a set of reasons

31
00:02:56,496 --> 00:02:59,836
First of all , Wall street operates under a set of  regulatory constrains

32
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:02,356
that they cannot afford to just ignore

33
00:03:02,446 --> 00:03:07,232
Their central bankers or  their various different securitie or derivative regulators. Their conduct regulators

34
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:13,707
I have a front seat to the question about can bitcoin technology and blockchain technology work in regulated environement

35
00:03:13,732 --> 00:03:16,815
because I am on a board of the company Coinbase which is

36
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:21,954
probably the leading exchange and hosted wallet provider here in United States

37
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:24,254
one of the leading company around the world

38
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:27,042
And they have to operate in a regulated environment

39
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:29,214
if you look at the Bitcoin debate  right now

40
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:31,858
where they are arguing over  the block size

41
00:03:31,883 --> 00:03:34,210
and they are having a trouble scaling that system

42
00:03:34,634 --> 00:03:38,563
and they are only at a  point of now where they can  handle 7 transactions a second

43
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:45,265
and The world global finance handles thousands if not tens of thousands 
, hundreds of thousands of transactions every second

44
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,361
if you includes  credit card swipes and trades and securities etc,etc.

45
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:54,266
I am not yet convinced the  private block chain is anything new

46
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:59,968
It's probably a tool to help  information sharing  between Banks

47
00:03:59,993 --> 00:04:10,896
But then , if you consider the infomation sharing has to be associated with common codes of business practise.

48
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:17,917
then you also have to consider that it is a  route towards cartelization of the   banking sector

49
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:21,791
and in worse case scenario , it creates one bank system

50
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:30,049
at a high leve, I just kind-of  think it is  an industry  grapling with a new technology  not really liking what they see

51
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:33,581
